My friend Manish is fond of writing blogs but don't know to code<br />
So I created a blog website for him where he can publish his work<br />
and he can edit/delete/add blogs and can access contact info of others <br />
If You want to read then [Go to blog](https://secret-keepers.herokuapp.com)<br />
He can edit it by logging with his id/password in [admin panel](https://secret-keepers.herokuapp.com/admin/)
